Pre-requisites
==============

Of course, Pulse2 server is needed in order to leverage all these marvellouse
tools. However, build and installation does not requires Pulse2 server.

To build and install, following tools are needed:
 - unzip
 - bzip2
 - wget
 - gcc
 - make
 - patch
 - libnewt-dev
 - zlib1g-dev
 - e2fslibs-dev
 - libgcrypt11-dev
 - quilt
 - automake1.9
 - autoconf

Quick installation
==================

Build must be done in an i386 environment.

$ make
# As root
$ make install

Cross-environment installation
==============================

- Method 1: build and install in different dirs

You may want to install the imaging client in an environment which is different 
from the one where it was built. To achieve this, you may share the source tree 
through NFS between both env (build and install) then:

# From the build environment 
$ make
# From the install environment, as root
$ make install-nobuild

- Method 2: create binary tarball

The target 'binary' creates a tarball with pre-compiled binaries which can be 
decompressed on '/'.
